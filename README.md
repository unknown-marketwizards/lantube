# LanTube

[简体中文](README.zh.md)

I have always had such troubles：

> Videos downloaded on the Internet（cannot be posted to public platforms due to copyright issues）,
> need to be played on computer and mobile phone (tablet),
> But don’t want to copy the video to each device, so there is this project.
